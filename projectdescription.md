The main goal of this project was to analyze the price of Apple stock based on data collected from 1980 - 2022, utilizing common financial models such as the Binnomial Pricing model and
the Black Scholes model. The data set contained open, close, high, low, and adjusted prices, as well as the volume (number of shares traded), change in pecent, and average volume over a twenty day period values
for each day from the day Apple went public (December 12, 1980) until June 17, 2022. 

For simplicity, this project focused on data in the date range January 1, 2016 - December 31, 2021. This coincided with the iPhone's 10 year anniversary, the release 
of the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone X, Apple Watch Series 7, and the AirPods Max, as well as the introduction of Apple Pay and Apple Cash. Apple was one of the most valuable publicly
traded companies globally during this time span, reaching a milestone $1 trillion market capitalization in 2018. 

The Black Scholes and the Binomial Option Pricing model were used separately during this project to compare the results from each pricing model to see if there was a difference, if any, 
in the results from each models. A binomial tree was used to visually display when the best time to buy or sell the option was at an indicated time.
